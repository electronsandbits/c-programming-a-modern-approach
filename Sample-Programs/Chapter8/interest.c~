/* 
 * File: interest.c 
 * ----------------
 * This program prints a table showing the value of $100 invested
 * at different rates of interest over a period of years.
 * The user will enter an interest rate and the number of
 * years the money  will be invested.The table will show the 
 * value of the money at one-year intervals- at that interest rate
 * and the next four higher rates- assuming that interest is compounded
 * once a year.
 *
 * This program  require two for loops. The outer loop will count from 1
 * to the number of years requested by the user.The inner loop will increment
 * the interest rate from its lowest value to its highest value.
