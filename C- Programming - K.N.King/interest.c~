 * This program prints a table showing the value of $100 invested
 * at different rates of interest over a period of years.
 * The user will enter an interest rate and the number of
 * years the money  will be invested.The table will show the 
 * value of the money at one-year intervals- at that interest rate
 * and the next four higher rates- assuming that interest is compounded
 * once a year.
